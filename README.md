# Analyzing Job Market Data in Power BI

In this Power BI case study, I’ll explore a real-world job posting dataset for a fictional recruitment company - DataSearch. I’ll use DAX to build insightful visualizations of my findings. I’ll bring it all together using everything Power BI has to offer and I’ll create a business dashboard.
